Minimal static site generator

I have tried to build a static site generator [before](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/monk), but it became too complex too fast.
So if you bump your head, try again, bump harder.

I ran into [blot](https://blot.im) by [David Merfield](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot). Love it! So this is my version of that but with Haxe (Blot is written in node.js and javascript).

This project started as an example in the documentation of [Haxe and the system targets](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/haxesys). It explains that you can have one codebase but multiple targets:

- cpp (C++)
- cs (C#)
- node.js
- python
- java
- neko
- lua


Remember it's WIP and probably will never finish

## About

> Static site generators focus on one main task: generate a complete static HTML-based site. This result does not rely on databases or other external data sources and therewith avoid any server-side processing when accessing the website.

## default haxe used

- Default Haxe [templates](https://haxe.org/manual/std-template.html)
- Haxelib markdown (a haxe markdown converter to html)
- Reading and writing
- Different System targets (Python, Java, etc)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling
- Drop-In Alternative for Font Awesome Icons: [ficons](https://ficons.fiction.com/)

## speed

Building speed... I have no idea if this is really the time (in milliseconds) is takes. Still figuring out what the fasters building system is...

Don't know which one: seems cpp is the fastest and node.js is second fastest.

```
[node] start: 65ms, current: 128ms, past:63ms
[python] start: 73ms, current: 287ms, past:214ms
[lua] start: 10ms, current: 259ms, past:249ms
[neko] start: 10ms, current: 430ms, past:420ms
[cpp] start: 0ms, current: 50ms, past:50ms
[cs] start: 49738705ms, current: 49738904ms, past:199ms
[java] start: 49742687ms, current: 49742917ms, past:230ms
```



## python

Because I primarily use the Haxe Python target, the `docs` folder uses the files generated by this target.

`build_move.html` uses the export of python

So export to `docs` would be;

```bash
haxe build_python.hxml
haxe build_move.html
```

And you have an updated docs.

(probably need to automate this better, but this works as well)
